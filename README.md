# Orgnode
Orgnode is a python library for parsing [Org files](http://orgmode.org). Orgnode was
created by [Charles Cave](http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/orgnode.html).

# Orgnode and python setuptools
The only reason for this repository is to make it possible to install
Orgnode using [python setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

Now you can use Orgnode in your app just by adding 
```
git+https://github.com/rdmnk/Orgnode.git 
```
to your `requirements.txt`
