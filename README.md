# Orgnode
Orgnode is a python library for parsing Org files. Orgnode was
created by [Charles Cave](http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/orgnode.html).

# Orgnode and python setuptools
The only reason for this repository is to make it possible to install
Orgnode using [python setuptools](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

Now you can use Orgnode in your app just by adding 
```
	git+https://github.com/rdmnk/Orgnode.git 
```
to your `requirements.txt`

# [Org-mode for Emacs](http://orgmode.org)
"Org mode is for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning
projects, and authoring documents with a fast and effective plain-text
system"

# Others parsers for Org files
There are [plently tools](http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tools/index.html) for handling Org files.
